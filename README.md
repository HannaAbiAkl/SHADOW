[SHADOW](https://huggingface.co/HannaAbiAkl/shadow) (**S**ymbolic **H**igher-order **A**ssociative **D**eductive reasoning **O**n **W**ikidata) is a model that is a fine-tuned version of flan-t5-small on the LM-KBC 2024 dataset.

This is the official code repository for the [LM-KBC](https://lm-kbc.github.io/challenge2024/) challenge paper at the [International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC) 2024](https://iswc2024.semanticweb.org/event/3715c6fc-e2d7-47eb-8c01-5fe4ac589a52/websitePage:31a4e26d-8447-40e9-b5e9-d983446a80c8): ["Project SHADOW: Symbolic Higher-order Associative Deductive reasoning On Wikidata using LM probing"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14849).
